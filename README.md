## How to contribute to Minswap translation

- All language files are in format `{ "id": "text" }`.
- Keep the `id` intact and only modify the `text`.
- The `<a>...</a>` meta is used for styling.
- The `{0}` meta is used for parameterizing.
- All untranslated lines are pushed to the beginning of the files for convenience.
